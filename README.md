The concept of tfidf and inverted index was relied upon to represent the data, perform document searches using cosin simalrity, and arrange the returned documents depending on them.
The idea of document clustering was added to speed up the search process and obtain more accurate results
Then we built the search page using html and used flask to associate the page with system services
